ThisOrThat is an application made to allow a community of users to vote between two choices. Users can create a poll with two options and the rest of the entire user base can vote on either one. By the end of the voting period, users can see the final results and choose an option if they wish to.
Used Swift to develop the iOS application and Ruby on Rails for the web application and iOS API.
